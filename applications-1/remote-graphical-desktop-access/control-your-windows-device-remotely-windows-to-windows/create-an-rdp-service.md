# Create an RDP Service

In order to make a connection to your newly registered Device, you will need to add an RDP Service to it. This is not one of the Services available to quick-add when you were registering your Device. 

In the _Settings_ tab, click on the name of your Device. Under “Hosted Services”, click the “Add manually” button.

Enter a Service name. Then, under “Type”, select “RDP” from the drop-down menu.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NOTE:** The correct port \(3389\) and host address will be selected by default. Do not change these values.
{% endhint %}

Adding a Service does not open this port to the internet, and will only be accessible from your remote.it account. This makes remote.it much more secure than traditional methods.

Click the check-mark to save the Service and click “Yes” when prompted.

![I&apos;ve set up an RDP Service. I called mine RDP Service because it&apos;s easy to keep track of.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vmImgEaMlxcdXs_jmKZnsxRhDS0GObu42qflUc6vwUa-Lm1Zzgpvz3_RtIKpfcZ4iDjGWrBsQFkJgIhuSrbFAjG2tSo-oI-VJ8e9PDuZJCAGML_RqPbqItrVzIV2nA9zoghkSUQ)

Next, navigate to the _Devices_ tab and refresh the page. The Device you just registered will now be displayed. If you click on it, you will also see the RDP Service you just registered. 

Now you are ready to connect remotely.
