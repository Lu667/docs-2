* Product Name: Think of this as a group of Services \(e.g. ssh, http, vnc\).  Give this group a name to help you remember it.
* Product Platform: Select the platform that your Services will be running on from the list.  If you can't find an exact match, choose the closest option.  It does not affect the functionality of remote.it.
* Product Scope: 
  * Private - this Product is only visible in your account.
  * Public - visible and usable by all remote.it accounts
  * Unlisted - can be used in multiple accounts, but does not appear in the "Public" list.

Note: your Bulk Identification Code will be different from this one.  

With the Bulk Identification Code from the Product Definition, you can create one or more Bulk Registrations.  Typically a Bulk Registration might match a production run of Platforms.  The Bulk Identification Code needs to be written to each Platform that is part of a given Bulk Registration.  Follow the "Next" link below to learn how.
