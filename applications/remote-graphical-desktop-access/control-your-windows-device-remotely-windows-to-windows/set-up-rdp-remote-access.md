# Set up RDP Remote Access

In order to remotely access a Windows machine, you must set the RDP permissions on the machine you wish to connect to.

First, open the “Control Panel” and navigate to “System and Security”.

![This computer is running Windows 10.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/guZgwpsb6tDWTsJcESawJgsaClTD5rcyeYs4F7ahOIZ2N6-F2Exvti98LLUx0IWRwQjZnreKxGu-uFQ_aH-mwVMrDgo5yBWOkF0Pd_H4kxUTjFMwy1a54OUNLlyxg2RQey5xVZHI)

Find “System” and click “Allow remote access”.

![You may have to enter your administrator password when changing some of these options.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UC8_k_WWs3s-eLLots2HoRm_sEvfK0D_yq4ZsyKEaY3lk33Dr47qT1lbhaSnlU7bY6QwFgtRFNZm8VZcdzMuQ6EkjSxvwmCF9ER8jje2n4gBWd0wlXk8ts4thL067S3kjXQ_a_Nb)

A “System Properties” window will open with the “Remote” tab already selected.

Under “Remote Desktop”, select “Allow remote connections to this computer”.

![Make sure to apply and press &quot;OK&quot; to save your changes.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1swtp9WZs_0XO2iv5WIkXdOOaK8uSARR-z8PHHFZnQVfORuA1FcsAgiohwdFz9F60xS10mKl1wgdEdPCJ4QYPrh0cxiKm-zDnuUQ8M_MmAxTfotL5jPKi0-NO0ltdjeT57up3yYj)

Please note that these options will not be present if your computer is set to go to sleep while not in use.  
Additionally, you will not be able to remotely access a computer that is asleep.

To change the sleep settings, go back to “System and Security” and click on “Power Options”.

Next to Balanced, click “Change plan settings”.

Make sure that these settings are saved by click "Save changes". Make sure that the remote connection options are also properly saved, as detailed above.

RDP is now enabled on your Windows machine!
