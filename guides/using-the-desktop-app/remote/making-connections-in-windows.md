# Making connections in Windows

Make sure your connection is active \(blue\).

If you see the green "Connect" button, click on it and wait until it turns blue as shown above.

#### Launch URL

You can see the connection URL and port, e.g. **localhost:33001**.  You can use this directly, or you can create a launch URL to streamline certain operations if your browser supports application launching.  This is more common on macOS.

* \[username\] is only available for SSH connections.  It is the SSH username you specified.
* \[host\] is usually localhost, or 127.0.0.1.
* \[port\] is the port assigned to this connection.

## SSH Connections

* The SSH username is a user-configurable login name that will be included in the connection login string.  This setting only appears on SSH connections.

When you select the clipboard icon as shown:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28354%29.png)



the SSH string, including the supplied SSH Username, is copied to the clipboard.  You can then paste it into a terminal or command prompt to initiate an SSH connection.  The SSH String is not the same as the editable Launch URL which only works if your browser supports that protocol.

* This is the "SSH string":

```text
ssh -l pi 127.0.0.1 -p 33002 -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -o "UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null"
```

* Pasting that into a Windows 10 command prompt gives:

```text
C:\Users\me>ssh -l pi 127.0.0.1 -p 33002 -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -o "UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null"
Warning: Permanently added '[127.0.0.1]:33002' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

You can use the SSH string in Linux and Mac terminal as well.

## VNC Connections

* When you select the clipboard icon, the VNC string is copied to the clipboard.  You can then paste it into your VNC application.

* This is the VNC string:

```text
127.0.0.1:33003
```

* This can be copied and pasted into the address bar of the RealVNC Viewer application.

* Provide the username and password to complete the VNC connection.
