  Now, you must register your computer as a remote.it Device and create a
  Service.

# Register the Device & Service

Open the remote.it Desktop App on the macOS computer that you would like to connect to remotely, and log in with your remote.it account. The Desktop App can be downloaded here:

**Mac download:**

The _Settings_ tab will be open. Click on “Set up remote access”.

Enter a Device name. Make sure it’s something that you will remember, as this is how you will identify this Device in your remote.it account. The default Device name is the name you’ve chosen for your computer.

You need to create a VNC Service on your macOS Device so that you can remotely connect to it using your Windows machine. The VNC service should appear below. Make sure it’s checked.

Then, click “Register”. You will be prompted to enter your Mac’s administrator credentials. Enter them, then click “Ok”. 

Next, navigate to the Devices tab and refresh the page. The Device you registered will be displayed. If you click on it, you can see the VNC Service you just created.

Note that registering your Device and adding this Service does not open this port to the internet, and will only be accessible from your remote.it account. 

You're now ready to remotely connect to your macOS computer using your Windows machine.

Continue with the tutorial:

## Optional: Add Services Manually

If the VNC Service did not appear, or if you want to add a Service that did not appear, you can click “Add from Network” or “Add manually”.
