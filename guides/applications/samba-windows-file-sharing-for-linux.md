# Samba Windows file sharing for Linux

The Samba package allows Linux PCs to access the file system of Windows PCs over a LAN.  See [https://www.samba.org/](https://www.samba.org/) for many more details.  Below, we demonstrate a configuration which uses a remote.it Samba Service on a Raspberry Pi configured for a LAN application \(pointed at the Samba server\) running on a Buffalo NAS device.  We use the remote.it Service installed on the Pi to access the Samba server on the NAS, where we don't have shell access and can't install remote.it directly.

First, [install connectd on your Raspberry Pi.](https://docs.remote.it/platforms/quick-start-on-raspberry-pi/install-remote.it)  Use the [interactive installer](https://docs.remote.it/guides/using-the-interactive-installer) to [add a remote.it Service to a LAN application](https://docs.remote.it/guides/using-the-interactive-installer/add-a-service-to-a-lan-application) pointing at the NAS \(192.168.1.254\) and configure it to use Samba on default port 445.

After giving the remote.it Service a name, you should see that the server at the IP address you gave is responding with "OK" in the "Application" column of this new remote.it Service.

Now, return to the remote.it web portal and connect by clicking on the remote.it Service name:

This returns the proxy server's URL and port in a generic dialog:

We will demonstrate the Samba [**smbclient** ](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html)command using this proxy address and port.  

* &lt;port&gt; - port value from the TCP connection dialog
* &lt;hostname&gt; - hostname from the TCP connection dialog
* &lt;folder&gt; - the NAS folder we are accessing  
* &lt;password&gt; - password on the Pi running the smbclient command

```text
smbclient -p <port> \\\\<hostname>\\<folder> <password>
```

```text
pi@raspberrypi-90:~ $ smbclient -p 32642 \\\\proxy13.remot3.it\\share raspberry
