# Mass Registration

## Overview

Mass Registration allows you to register many devices using a simple, automated process rather than manually having to configure each device, like you saw in our Quick Start guides.

## Auto Registration

Auto Registration is the easiest way to setup a device using remote.it. With Auto Registration, you create a Product Definition in the web portal which defines the services you would like to run on your products. Then, all you have to do is setup remote.it on one of your devices and then configure your registration key on the device, clone the firmware and then duplicate it for every new device you deploy.

## Bulk Registration

For now, please see [this PDF on Bulk Registration](https://github.com/remoteit/docs/blob/master/guides/remote.it%20Bulk%20Scripting.pdf).
