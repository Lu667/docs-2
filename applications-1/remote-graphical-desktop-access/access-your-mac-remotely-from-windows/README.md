# Access your Mac Remotely from Windows

## Overview

Usually, establishing a remote connection between two devices requires the insecure opening of ports on your internet router. With remote.it, however, it's possible to remotely control a device quickly, securely, and without opening ports.

Before we begin, please make sure that you have a remote.it account. If you do not have an account, please make one [**here.** ](www.remote.it)\*\*\*\*

Additionally, download and install the remote.it Desktop Application on both computers. For information on how to do that, see this guide:

You must also install a VNC client on the Windows PC. In this tutorial, we will be using RealVNC Viewer. You can download RealVNC Viewer [**here.**](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)\*\*\*\*

Finally, please ensure that both computers are powered, awake, and connected to the internet.

Please follow the simple steps below to configure remote access:

1. Enable Screen Sharing \(macOS\)
2. Register the Device & Service \(macOS\)
3. Connect Remotely \(Windows\)
