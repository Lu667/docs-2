# remote.it Connect for Windows Quick Start

## **Features**

remote.it Connect for Windows offers two modes:

1. **Initiator Mode** Create a peer to peer \(P2P\) connection from your Windows PC to any remote.it enabled Service on another device.
2. **Target Mode** Allow other authorized remote.it users to connect to your machine. Remote Desktop \(usually port 3389\) or a web server using IIS \(usually port 80\) are common uses. 

After you set them up, both types of remote.it connections will run whenever you start your Windows PC, whether the remote.it Connect for Windows application is running or not.
