You can also use remote.it Connect for Windows to set up incoming connections to TCP servers on your local Windows machine that other computers can connect to.

Those instructions show how to use remote.it with RDP using a proxy address supplied through the web portal, but of course if your client PC is also running remote.it Connect for Windows, you can configure a P2P connection.
