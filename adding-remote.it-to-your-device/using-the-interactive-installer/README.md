# The Interactive Installer

#### Raspberry Pi

We recommend that you use one of the following methods for installing remote.it onto a Raspberry Pi.

{% page-ref page="../raspberry-pi-quick-start.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../the-remoteit-package-for-raspbian.md" %}

#### Windows and macOS:

{% page-ref page="../../guides/using-the-desktop-app.md" %}

#### All other Linux

If you are using an OS other than Raspberry Pi Raspbian, Windows, or macOS, please follow the instructions at the following link to install remote.it's **connectd** package onto your Linux device.  

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the connectd package described below does not support the [find.remote.it](../find.remote.it.md) feature.
{% endhint %}

After you've finished installing the connectd package, you can configure remote.it Services to connect to your device's TCP-based servers such as SSH, VNC, http\(s\), etc.
