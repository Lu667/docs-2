Making a remote.it Proxy connection can be done using the remote.it web portal or the API's /device/connect endpoint.

For non-web connections, the connection will return a hostname and port values which can be used on a command line or in a GUI application depending on what you are doing.  The example below is for an SSH connection.

**Reverse proxy:**  For web applications made using the remote.it web portal, the reverse proxy URL opens automatically in a new browser tab.
