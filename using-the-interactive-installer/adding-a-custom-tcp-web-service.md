# Adding a custom TCP/Web service

If you want to change the active port used by a web server application, you can override the default port easily.  At the Protocol Selection Menu, select option 2.  

These connections will still automatically open a new browser tab when accessed at the remote.it web portal.

If you wish to set up a TCP service that is not SSH, VNC, http, or NxWitness, use option 5 on the Protocol Section Menu:

Answer "n" to the question.   

Next, enter a short mnemonic for the protocol \(e.g. rdp\), and the port you wish to use:

Give the new service a name:

Then you will return to the main menu.

Connections made at the remote.it web portal will open a generic dialog with hostname and port for this remote.it connection.
