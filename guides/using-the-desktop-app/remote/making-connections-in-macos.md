# Making connections in macOS

## SSH Connections

* The SSH username is a user-configurable login name that will be included in the connection login string.  This setting only appears on SSH connections.

* When you select the clipboard icon, the SSH string, including the supplied SSH Username, is copied to the clipboard.  You can then paste it into a terminal or command prompt to initiate an SSH connection.

* This is the "SSH string":

```text
ssh -l pi 127.0.0.1 -p 33002 -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -o "UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null"
```

* Pasting that into a Windows 10 command prompt gives:

```text
C:\Users\me>ssh -l pi 127.0.0.1 -p 33002 -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -o "UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null"
Warning: Permanently added '[127.0.0.1]:33002' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

You can use the SSH string in Linux and Mac terminal as well.

## VNC Connections

* When you select the clipboard icon, the VNC string is copied to the clipboard.  You can then paste it into your VNC application.

* This is the VNC string:

```text
127.0.0.1:33003
```

* This can be copied and pasted into the address bar of the RealVNC Viewer application.
