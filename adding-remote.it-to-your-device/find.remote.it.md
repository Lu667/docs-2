The **remoteit** package is an update over the older **connectd** package.  This update enables a fully web based configuration tool for your local area network.

Once you have a remoteit enabled device running on your network, you can access it using http://find.remote.it.  Use the left and right arrows to navigate through all of your LAN devices if you have more than one.
