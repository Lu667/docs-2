# Select a Contact

When you share or transfer a remote.it Device, you will be asked to choose one or more contacts.

Sharing allows you to select multiple contacts to shard your remote.it Device\(s\) with.

Transferring requires you to select just one contact as the recipient of your remote.it Device\(s\).

When you select either "Share" or "Transfer" from the "Actions" menu, you will see this dialog:

Select the contacts you wish to share to.  When you're done, click on  "Choose Contacts".

{% hint style="info" %}
 If you are doing a device transfer, be sure to just select a single contact.
{% endhint %}

The chosen contact\(s\) will be displayed in the Share or Transfer dialog.
