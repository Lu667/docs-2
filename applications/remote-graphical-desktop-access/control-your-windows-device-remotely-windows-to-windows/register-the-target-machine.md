# Register the Target Machine

The next step is to register the target machine as a Device with remote.it. This enables you to use remote.it to connect to your Device from anywhere.

First, open the remote.it Desktop App on the target machine and sign in. You can download the Desktop App here:

**Windows download:**

Navigate to the _Settings_ tab and click on “Set up remote access”.

Enter a Device name that is easy to remember. This is how you will identify the Device in your remote.it account. The default name is the name of your system. Register the Device and click “Yes” when prompted.
