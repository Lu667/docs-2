* If you do select this option, the Status Columns will update as messages arrive from your script, however you will not be able to select any other devices until this process has completed.
* If you don't select this option, status updates may be delayed slightly.

If your script uses commands to update the status columns, you will see that information fill in as the script proceeds.
