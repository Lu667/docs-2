Please download the latest release [**here.**](https://github.com/remoteit/cli/releases/latest)\*\*\*\*

* For Raspberry PI use `remoteit_linux_armv6`

  * Place it onto your system `PATH` \(usually `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`\)
  * `sudo cp ./remoteit_linux_armv6 /usr/local/bin/remoteit`

* For Linux use `remoteit_linux_x86_64`

  * Place it onto your system `PATH` \(usually `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`\)
  * `sudo cp ./remoteit_linux_x86_64 /usr/local/bin/remoteit`

* For Mac use `remoteit_mac-osx_x86_64`

  * Place it onto your system `PATH` \(usually `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`\)
  * `sudo cp ./remoteit_mac-osx_x86_64 /usr/local/bin/remoteit`

* For Windows use `remoteit_windows_x86_64.exe`
  * Place it onto your system `PATH` \(usually `C:\Windows`\)
  * `copy remoteit_windows_x86_64.exe C:\windows\`

## Setup

Using the remote.it CLI is consistent across platforms but please note:

* On Windows, you will need to open a "Command Prompt" as an Administrator and replace any example you see from `sudo remoteit` to `remoteit.exe` 
* On Mac and Linux, you will need to run any commands related to creating/managing a Device or Services as a root user \(e.g. `sudo`\) so that we can install and manage system Services to keep your Device running. 
* Note that the remote.it CLI has slightly different behavior if you are running as a root user versus a non-root user. In general, you will want to always run as a root user unless you have a specific reason not to.

### Quick start

Getting a new Device setup in your remote.it account using our CLI is easy as 1-2-3:

```text
sudo remoteit signin # First - signin into your account
sudo remoteit setup # Then - setup a Device
sudo remoteit add # Finally - add services (as many as needed)
```
