# Service types

Virtually **anything that communicates over a single TCP** **port** can be used with remote.it including:

* SSH
  * SCP
  * SFTP
* VNC
* http\(s\)
* Nx Witness
* RDP
* Samba
* ...and much more!

For service types that you don't see in the selection list, just _choose "TCP" as the service type._
