# Using the Web Portal

The web portal \(app.remote.it\) is an interface to make connections with remote.it. Currently, the web portal creates **proxy connections**, which route information through one of our proxy servers.

Prerequisites: You'll need a remote.it account, which you can create at https://app.remote.it.
{% endhint %}

### The Left Menu

When you log into the portal, the first page will be the Devices page. You can navigate to other pages using the menu on the left hand side.

If you have one, your gravatar will appear on the top. The dropdown arrow will reveal a few other helpful pages, including external links \(marked with a small arrow\), the account you're on, and account settings.
