  The Network tab is where you can scan for active TCP services on your Device
  or any other device on the LAN, whether it has remote.it installed on it or
  not.

# Network

 You can get here either by click the network icon in the bottom bar or by selecting "Scan for services"  
 under the Hosted tab. 

The App will auto-detect which network adapter you are currently using, but if you are connected to multiple networks and want to select a different one, you can use the dropdown menu in the upper left.

Clicking the "SCAN" button will scan your current network for active TCP services. From the displayed list you can click on an IP address to see the possible TCP services available to add remote.it Services to. Your local system will be labeled "This system" and have a different icon.

{% hint style="info" %}
Known issue: all possible IP addresses are shown, rather than just the ones which are present on your LAN.
{% endhint %}
