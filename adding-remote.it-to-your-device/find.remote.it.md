  find.remote.it is a network tool that lets you locate and connect to or
  register all the devices on your LAN which have remoteit installed.

# find.remote.it

The **remoteit** package is an update over the older **connectd** package.  This update enables a fully web based configuration tool for your local area network.

Once you have a remoteit enabled device running on your network, you can access it using http://find.remote.it.

Click on "Connect" to access Devices which you've already configured.

You'll have to log in, if you haven't already.

Now you are connected to your account's "Devices" view.  This shows all Devices already configured in your account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Unless you are looking at "Devices" view from the actual device displaying this list \(for example, using a keyboard and monitor on the Raspberry Pi, or the equivalent view in the remote.it App\), while you can manage peer to peer connections, you will not be able to launch a  session using the connection info.  That's because the connection info is for a peer to peer connection which is only valid on the target computer.
{% endhint %}
