# Adding a custom TCP/Web service

If you want to change the active port used by a web server application, you can override the default port easily.  At the Protocol Selection Menu, select option 2, then follow the onscreen prompts.  

Web \(http\) and Secure Web \(https\) connections will automatically open a new browser tab when accessed at the remote.it web portal.

If you wish to set up a TCP service that is not SSH, VNC, http\(s\), or NxWitness, use option 6 on the Protocol Section Menu:

Next, enter the port you wish to use:

Give the new service a name:

Then you will return to the main menu.

Connections to TCP Services made at the remote.it web portal will open a generic dialog with hostname and port.
