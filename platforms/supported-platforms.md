## Raspberry Pi with Raspbian Stretch

The Pi Foundation hosts the connectd package at their repositories for a streamlined installation experience.  If you are using Raspbian Stretch, follow the link below.  For older versions of Raspbian or any other Linux OS running on Raspberry Pi, skip ahead to "Download a package for any Linux".

## Download a package for any Linux

The auto-install.sh script will download and install a Debian package if you have a Debian based OS.  For all others, a tar file is downloaded and extracted to your system.  A list of files contained in the tar file can be found in /etc/connectd/builddate.txt.

To run the auto-install-sh script, copy and paste the following 3 lines to your console:

```text
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remoteit/installer/master/scripts/auto-install.sh
chmod +x ./auto-install.sh
sudo ./auto-install.sh
```

If you don't see any warnings, run:

`sudo connectd_installer`

to proceed to configure your device.
