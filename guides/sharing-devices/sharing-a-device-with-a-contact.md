# Sharing a device with a contact



**Sharing a Device in your account to one of your Contacts**

Return to the "View Devices" page and select the checkbox\(es\) on the left side of the row\(s\) showing the Device\(s\) you wish to share.  Note that prior to sharing, the Share icon has no arrows point towards or away from it.

The Contact\(s\) you selected will get a notification e-mail which they will need to open and click on the link to accept the sharing invitation.

You'll see a "Sharing Confirmation" dialog, which you should read and then close.

Once the Sharing operation is completed, your Device will now show up in their "View Devices" page with an incoming arrow on the "Share" icon:

By hovering your mouse cursor over the share icon, you can quickly see who has shared it to you.

There will be an outgoing arrow on the Share icon for a Device you have shared to someone else:

Now your contact will be able to connect to any remote.it Service on the shared Device as if it belonged to them.  Please note:

* The user to whom a Device has been shared cannot change its name.
* It is not possible to share a single Service on a Device.
