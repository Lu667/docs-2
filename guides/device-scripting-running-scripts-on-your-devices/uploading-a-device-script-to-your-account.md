# Uploading a Device Script to your account

You upload and manage Device Scripts in your account for use at any time.

Start by using the sample script in the first example, which you can find using the link below.

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/show-device-info.sh" caption="show-device-info.sh" %}

Select "Scripting" from the menu:

In the "Storage Upload" dialog, use "Choose File" to locate the script file you've downloaded or written.

Make sure that "Executable script or program" is selected, then click on "Upload".

Note that existing scripts will be overwritten without any warning.

The "Storage Upload" dialog will stay open until you click on "Cancel" to make it easier to upload multiple scripts.
