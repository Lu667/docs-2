2. Give this service a name to help you remember what it does.

3. Choose the TCP port that the application uses on your device.

4. Choose whether the Service will be enabled by default or not. If it is not enabled by default, the setting to enable it can be set later. In that case, the devices using this Product Definition must be rebooted to pick up the changes.
