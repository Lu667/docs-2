# Verify Bulk Registration

If you have correctly followed all of the steps in this section, you should be able to reboot your Platform, and after it boots up, the corresponding Device should appear online in the remote.it "Devices" page.

### Debugging Bulk Registration

In the unlikely event that your Device does not appear online with 5 minutes after booting, please try the following.

Confirm that the Bulk Identification Code, Hardware ID, and Registration Key all look correct:

```text
~ $ connectd_control show
Hardware ID is f0038c1be545
Registration key is 1c1b0dbe190e
Bulk ID Code is 2513F28C-13AD-BEBE-7329-D70C2F5F34A6
~ $
```

Perform a factory reset of the device.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Factory reset clears any downloaded configuration files from your device.  If this device had completed bulk registration already, in order to bulk register this specific device again, you’ll need to first delete the Bulk Registration which referenced this device \(on the Registrations page of the web portal\), and then re-upload and publish the Bulk Registration CSV file again. Use Factory Reset with caution!
{% endhint %}

```text
~ $ sudo connectd_control reset
OK: factory reset
~ $
```

Trigger the download of provisioning \(configuration\) files.  You should see a file download for each Service configured in your Product Definition \(including the Bulk Service\).

```text
$ sudo connectd_control -v dprovision
.

Trigger the connection of the daemons to your account.  You should see the "provisioned... enabled... started" sequence for each Service configured in your Product Definition \(including the Bulk Service\).
