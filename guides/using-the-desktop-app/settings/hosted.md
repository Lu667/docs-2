# Set up remote access

In this tab you can register and add Services to your local Device. Note that some commonly used services have been located and may be pre-selected.  If you don't want to register Services on any particular port\(s\) at this time, deselect the appropriate checkbox.  You can always manage installed Services later.

Choose a name and click the **Register** button. At this point, you may be asked to enter your administrator information.

After you've registered your Device and any preselected Services, you can either add your own custom service or use the network scanner to automatically ﬁnd services on the LAN or your Device.

Give the new Service a name and select the Service type. A typical value for the port will be ﬁlled in automatically, however you can change the port and/or host address if you wish. Then click the blue check mark to save this Hosted Service.
