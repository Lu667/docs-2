# Features

### Client and target configuration in one

While the most obvious use of the remote.it Desktop App is as a client to initiate connections to other devices, it also allows configuration of connection targets, or remote.it Services, on the local device.

### Peer to peer connections

Peer to peer connections offer better data throughput than the remote.it web portal or the REST API. Peer to peer connections also persist until manually closed and feature throughput monitoring.

### Quick launching

Persistent connections make it easy for you to bookmark your remote.it connections in your other applications.  The remote.it Desktop App also lets you configure a command line to launch other services with a single click. HTTP, SSH, and VNC are all supported integrations.

### LAN sharing of remote Services

The Desktop App allows you to share a connection with other users on the network. You can connect to a remote device and allow other users to connect to it through your systemâ€™s LAN IP address on the port you choose. Your local shared connections have the same great security as a remote proxy, only on your private network.

### Hosted services

Like the remote.it web portal, the remote.it Desktop App provides a client to connect to Services on your Devices. In addition, it allows you to configure a connection to services running on your desktop PC, such as Mac screen sharing, Virtual Network Console \(VNC\), Remote Desktop for Windows, SSH, etc.

### Network scanning

Local area network scanning is now built in. Scan your network for local services and add them quickly and easily with a click.  This lets you make remote.it connections to LAN devices without installing any software on them.
