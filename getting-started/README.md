# Getting started

## Welcome to remote.it!

If you're new to using remote.it, this is the place for you!

In this section, we will show you how to get up and running with remote.it on a real device and start securely remote connecting and controlling your devices.

Please follow one of our Guides below if you're new to remote.it:

{% page-ref page="../platforms/centos-quick-start/" %}

{% page-ref page="../platforms/windows-quick-start/" %}

### More platforms!

remote.it works with virtually any platform or device, not just Raspberry Pi and Debian systems. We are actively working on adding more guides for other platforms, but until then, [please contact us](http://support.remot3.it) for help getting set up with your platform!
